# Linear-Recurrent-Units-Tensorflow
Unofficial implementation of Linear Recurrent Units, by Deepmind, in Tensorflow.

Implementation of Linear Recurrent Units, by Deepmind, in Tensorflow. LRUs are inspired by Deep State-Space Machines, particularly S4 and S5.

# Notes:
+ For an implementation that supports 3-dimensional input sequences, you might want to take a look at https://github.com/Gothos/LRU-pytorch. It is likely slower due to lack of associative scans, though.
