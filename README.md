# Linear Recurrent Units in Tensorflow: An Unofficial Implementation
This repository presents an unofficial implementation of Linear Recurrent Units (LRUs) proposed by Deepmind, utilizing Tensorflow. LRUs draw inspiration from Deep State-Space Machines, with a particular focus on S4 and S5 models.

# Notes:
+ If you require an implementation that supports 3-dimensional input sequences, you may want to refer to <a href='https://github.com/Gothos/LRU-pytorch'>github.com/Gothos/LRU-pytorch</a>. However, please be aware that this alternative implementation might be slower due to the absence of associative scans.
